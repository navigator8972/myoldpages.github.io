I am a PhD researcher at [GAIPS](https://gaips.inesc-id.pt/), IST, University of Lisbon and [LASA](http://lasa.epfl.ch/), EPFL, working on topics of Robot Learning, Human-Robot Interaction and Artificial Intelligence. My research interests is the intersection  of robotics and machine learning, with a special focus on human-centered applications. I am enthusiastic about learning-based robotics that can be seamlessly integrated with general human knowledge and well-established techniques, such as dynamical systems and optimization-based control. I believe this would be a promising path towards greater robot autonomy and intelligence, which are necessary for robots to closely serve or work with humans. 

I received my PhD from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/) and [IST, University of Lisbon](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) under the supervision of Prof. [Aude Billard](http://lasa.epfl.ch/people/member.php?SCIPER=115671), Prof. [Ana Paiva](https://ana-paiva.com/) and Prof. [Francisco S. Melo](http://gaips.inesc-id.pt/~fmelo/). Prior to that, I completed my master and bachelor study in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). I was also working as a software engineer in Siemens.
