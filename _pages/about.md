I am a tenure-track assistant professor with the Department of Computer Science ([DIKU](https://di.ku.dk/english)), University of Copenhagen. I am enthusiastic about finding and integrating problem structures, such as task representation, dynamical systems and optimization-based control, to facilitate learning-based robotics. I believe this would be a promising path towards greater robot autonomy and intelligence, which are necessary for robots to closely serve or work with humans. 

I obtained my PhD from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/) and [IST, University of Lisbon](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) under the supervision of Prof. [Aude Billard](http://lasa.epfl.ch/people/member.php?SCIPER=115671), Prof. [Ana Paiva](https://ana-paiva.com/) and Prof. [Francisco S. Melo](http://gaips.inesc-id.pt/~fmelo/). Prior to my current appointment, I was a post-docotoral researcher at the [Robotics, Perception and Learning Group](https://www.kth.se/rpl), KTH Royal Institute of Technology, mentored by Prof. [Danica Kragic](https://www.kth.se/profile/dani) and co-leading research on deformable object manipulation, learning contact-rich tasks and multi-modal data generation and representation.
