This research contributes to the [**CoWriter**](https://gaips.inesc-id.pt/component/gaips/projects/showProject/10/27) project, which aims to build robotic system that interacts with children to help them to acquire handwriting skills. The research exploits the idea of *learning-by-teaching* framework: the robot plays the role of a learner while children polish their skills in teaching the robot.
